## Initialization
The Methods made available by the GrassdoorFramework exposes features which are available in our Grassdoor App.

To get started, Initialize the GrassdoorManager in AppDelegate.
```swift
import Foundation
import GrassdoorFramework

class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
  func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil
  ) -> Bool {
      GrassdoorManager.shared.configure(application: UIApplication.shared, launchOptions: [:])
    return true
  }
}
```
## Set Delivery Details and Delivery Type
```swift
GrassdoorManager.shared.setUserDeliveryDetails(address: Grassdoor.Address)
```

#### Parameters
+ `Grassdoor.Address` holds the user delivery address.
  
  `init(zipcode: String, address: String, placeId: String, addressId: Int, latitude: Double, longitude: Double, state: String, city: String, country: String, zoneName: String)`

#### Note: 
+ To receive precise formatted address, either pass latitude & longitude or place_id(placeId from Google places API).
+ If both the params are passed then place_id will have higher priority to get formatted address
+ If only zipcode is passed, the function will only store the zipcode in localStorage & return default address

SShopData.setDelivery(type: Grassdoor.DeliveryType, onCompletion: ((Grassdoor.Operation?) -> Void)?)
